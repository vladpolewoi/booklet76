This is Booklet creator for PDF.
I like to print books and since in macOS you no longer can create booklets from pdf while printing I decided to make my own :)
It orders pages to be printed 4 pages (2 front and 2 back) on one sheet of paper and 5 pages per stack. In total 10 PDF pages on 5 sheets of paper.
